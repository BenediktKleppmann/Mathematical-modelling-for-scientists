There are different theories of inference:
* maximum likelihood - you specify that d(ln(L(y|θ)))/d(θ) = 0   and d²(ln(L(y|θ)))/d(θ)² < 0
advantages of maximum likelihood: unbiased, linear, minimum variance, invariance to continuously increasing the sample size

* estimator inference - choose an estimator with your favourite criteria 
unbiased = the mean of multiple small samples is around the true value, 
consistenct = as the sample size goes to infinity, the estimate goes towards the true value (law of large numbers)
efficient = it has minimum variance
linear, asymptotic normality (central limit theorem), asymptotic efficiency )
