There are two types of scientific knowledge: macroscopic patterns and microscopic models

macroscopic patterns
macroscopic patterns are some (usually approximate) relationships between macroscopic variables
e.g. "eating X increases the risk of cancer"

With this pattern glosses over all the microscopic details - we know that eating X will have various effects on different molecular pathways in our body and that these effects are what actually causes the cancer. 

Such an approximate/simplistic macroscopic pattern doesn't really get us closer to understanding the actual system - the molecular reactions in the human body. If done corretly, they can however still be very useful for decision making. E.g. deciding wether to allow a medicine or deciding which color wall is the most soothing in mental institutions.

Another example for macroscopic patterns is the mayan calendar. By tracking the regular intervals between solar and lunar eclipses, the mayans were able to predict them exceedingly accurately. They however probably knew very little about planetary dynamics and the structure of our solar system.


microscopic models
a micropscopic model is a description of how we think a real-world system works. This includes: its components, their behaviours/interactions and the processes/structures necessary for creating various observed phenomena.

For example:
molecular biology - model of the molecules in our bodies and how they interact
mechanics - model of how solid objects move and interact

Whereas the macroscopic patterns are only useful for a very specific question - e.g. determining if one substance is cancerogenic or predicting when solar eclipses happen on earth - the macroscopic rules can be used to model any system. E.g. Microbiology allows us to identify any number of cancerogenic substances or using the mechanics, we can simulate any solar system and use this to predict not only solar eclipses, but any cosmological event.

We know how any system will behave.

This flexibility of microscopic models is incredibly powerful

None of our modern technology would be possible without the great power and flexibility microscopic models. They allow engineers to design and accurately simulate ... 
any machine or apparatus (mechanics, fluid mechanics,electromagnetism, thermodynamics), 
any construction/infrastructure (statics, dynamics, fluid mechanics), design and accurately simulate any molecules (quantum chemistry), 
any chemical processes (chemistry)
predict chemical reactions and material properties chemical reactions, material properties (solid state physics)

comes from having a set of behaviour rules that is generally applicable i.e. that hold true in any scenario.


For comparison, the macroscopic rules are single rules that can't be combined and that are always only valid in a very specific scenario.
The microscopic models on the other had have an set of everywhere-applicable rules

These microscopic models are incredibly powerful. Whereas macroscopic rules have helped with individual decisions. The microscopic models for solid objects ("mechanics") and electric systems ("electromagnetism") are used every day to design

Microscopic models are much more generalisable than macroscopic rules. e.g. 


Not suprisingly, scientific models are the main focus of science. A lot of the work with scientific models lies not only in finding them, but seeing how they apply in practice (reconciling them with observations) e.g. history. For historians a basic model of how humans could possibly behave is presupposed, the chalenge lies in finding a structure/story

Even for a subject like history, we could say that there is a pre-supposed model of the type of things humans are capable of and the challenge consists of finding a story that
