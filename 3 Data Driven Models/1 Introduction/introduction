What to do when you cannot guess the right equation? What if your theoretically derived equations don't match real world data?
In such cases, many scientists in the past looked at the data for inspiration. Instead of basing your hypothesized equations on theory, you could just check what equation will fit the data best.

This approach has been successfully used by many scientists 

e.g. Kepler's laws of planetary motion
Johannes Kepler fit an equation to the meticullusly collected data from Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe.
