What is a scientific model?
Really, any hypothesis about the world is a scientific model. 
A scientific model claims that the world consists of certain objects/entities with specific behaviours.

e.g. the world is a disc which is carried by four elefants, which in turn are carried by a turtle that is swimming through space.

Object: elefant
Behaviour: doesn't move much, doesn't require food or air

Object: turtle
Behaviour: swims through space



What makes a good scientific model?
falsifyability - can we make experiments to test this?
logical consistency - have all questions been answered? e.g. where do the elefants come from? where does the turtle come from? why do they do what they do?
