Extremely powerful:
ability to accurately simulate any system allows you to e.g. evolutionary design of spray nossle
The ability to make these accurate simulations means that you can find an accurate answer for any question (except if it is too far in the future - the simulaltions of complex systems (e.g. weather) usually get inaccurate when going too far into the future)
completely solved science
As long as no new observations are made that stand in conflict , no new work has to be done here and the equations established in the 18th, 19th and 20th century will be used for always.

On the other side , this means there is not much opportunity for new research in these areas.
There are other areas that have eluded any attempts 
In these fields there are as good as no findings where you can safely assume that they will be considered just as true in 500 years.
Unfortunately, for social sciences the systems are much more complicated and the traditional methods haven't worked

For social sciences
simulations can theoretically capture and model all the complexity there is.
But they are wrong. The
